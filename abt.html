        Hiya! My name is Gabi... \(｡･ v ･｡)</p>
      <p class="text" id="bleb">he/him</p>
      <p class="text">I'm from Miami, Florida. At the moment, I'm currently attending <a
          href="https://nwsa.mdc.edu/">New World School of the
          Arts</a> in order
        to finish my Bachelor's in Art and Technology. I primarily focus on 2D Illustrations, Web Design, and
        Interactive Media. Aside from being bilingual with both Spanish and German, my professional traits include:
        Adobe, Microsoft, Blender, AR/VR, JavaScript and More!
      <p id="divider" class="text">--- ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ｡ ･---</p>
      <p class="text">
        My Dream Job is to create a platform where compassionate people can come together and help one another
        with life's most difficult obstacles. I am artistic, passionate, and enthusiastic in just about every project I
        set forth on completing. My biggest strength is my ability to not only design but calculate and rationalize
        those decisions in order to create a combination of both structure and aesthetics. Plus, I love to help others!
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In 2021, I finished <a href="https://magic.mdc.edu/">MDC MAGIC</a> with an Associates in Science for Art and
        Animation. I was, additionally, a
        Capstone Producer with Nickelodeon to create a professional 2D Animation called "<a href="
        https://youtu.be/22U0kMcQnQU">A Lesson in Magic</a>"! It was an
        outstanding experience being the first completely remote capstone to successfully run on live television in the
        USA, Brazil, and Mexico.
      </p>

      <p id="divider" class="text">--- ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ｡ ･---</p>

      <p class="text">Some of my favorite things to talk about with others can include Video Games, Book Series, and
        Original Content. I completely believe in the power of the imagination and it is my mission to find
        encouragement in not only myself but for others to create their own worlds, ideas, or characters. Additionally,
        I love going to Museums and am extremely passionate about saving the Planet from things like waste, neglect, or
        overheating. I hope that my work as an artist can have an impact on future generations because I want to become
        the role model I never had growing up.</p>

      <p class="text">
        Aside from University, I also participate in <a
          href="https://devpost.com/senjerak?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav">Hackathons</a>
        and hope to invite more alumni to join me. Having founded iClub, I'm currently running a digital group for
        fellow students to find a haven from the harsh, critial, and confusing world the internet can turn into without
        enough guidance. Art and Tech is the biggest division in NWSA and I am determined to shine a brilliant, bright
        light on students just like me who are hidden behind a computer screen. I know for a fact that we have something
        unique to contribute to the world and I refuse to allow anyone to dismiss that.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        It means the world to me to know that anyone, it doesn't matter who, could stumble accross any one of my page's
        and find happiness or confidence in themselves through my work. I want to leave an impression of kindness,
        open-mindedness, and welcoming arms with such a power and reach that the Internet has. If you are reading this
        now, know that I have all the love in my heart and appreciation for the fact that I could have your attention
        for even five minutes.
      </p>

      <p class="text">Thank You!</p>
