        Hiya! My name is Gabi... \(｡･ v ･｡)</p>
      <p class="text" id="bleb">he/him</p>
      <p class="text">I'm from Miami, Florida. At the moment, I'm currently attending <a
          href="https://nwsa.mdc.edu/">New World School of the
          Arts</a> in order
        to finish my Bachelor's in Art and Technology. I focus primarily on 2D Illustrations, Web Design, and
        Interactive Media. On the other hand, aside from creating art, I love to build Front-End websites as
        well as practice Video
        Editing,
        Photography, 3D Printing, and Tutoring. I also love my two cats: Harry & Vegeta!</p>
      <p class="text">I am looking for Apprentenceship, Internship, or any Career Guidance in the UI/UX
        Field.</p>

        My Dream Job is to create a platform where compassionate people can come together and help one another
        with life's most difficult obstacles. I am artistic, passionate, and enthusiastic in just about every project I
        set forth on completing... Plus: I love to help others!
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In 2021, I finished <a href="https://magic.mdc.edu/">MDC MAGIC</a> with an Associates in Science for Art and
        Animation. I was a
        Capstone Producer with Nickelodeon to create a professional 2D Animation called "<a href="
        https://youtu.be/22U0kMcQnQU">A Lesson in Magic</a>"! It was an
        outstanding experience being the first completely remote capstone to successfully run on live television in the
        USA, Brazil, and Mexico.
      </p>

      <p id="divider" class="text">--- ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ｡ ･---</p>

      <p class="text">Some of my favorite things to talk about with others can include Video Games, Book Series, and
        Original Content. I completely believe in the power of the imagination and it is my mission to find
        encouragement in not only myself but for others to create their own worlds, ideas, or characters. Additionally,
        I love going to Museums and am extremely passionate about saving the Planet from things like waste, neglect, or
        overheating. I hope that my work as an artist can have an impact on future generations because I want to become
        the role model I never had growing up.</p>

      <p class="text">
        Aside from University, I also participate in <a
          href="https://devpost.com/senjerak?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav">Hackathons</a>
        and hope to invite more alumni to join me.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        It means the world to me to know that anyone, it doesn't matter who, could stumble accross any one of my page's
        and find happiness or confidence in themselves through my work. I want to leave an impression of kindness,
        open-mindedness, and welcoming arms with such a power and reach that the Internet has. If you are reading this
        now, know that I have all the love in my heart and appreciation for the fact that I could have your attention
        for even five minutes.
      </p>

      <p class="text">Thank You!</p>
